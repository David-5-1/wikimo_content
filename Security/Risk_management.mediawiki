'''STATUS: READY'''

The goal of this document is to help understanding how risk is handled by the Enterprise Information Security Team
(Infosec) at Mozilla. The main goal is to strike a balance between speed and effectiveness while assessing risk for
decentralized teams and projects.
The Enterprise Information Security Team (Infosec) maintains this document as a reference guide for security engineers
and anyone interested in following our risk management processes.

Updates to this page should be submitted to the [https://github.com/mozilla/wikimo_opsec/ source repository on github].
Changes are detailed in the [https://github.com/mozilla/wikimo_opsec/commits/master commit history].

=== What is Risk? ===

Risk is the combination of the probable frequency and probable magnitude of future loss.
It is made of 2 components:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Impact''' ''(magnitude of future loss)''
| How does it affect our productivity, how much does it cost us, will negative media tarnish our image, how does it affect users' privacy, etc.?
|-
| '''Probability''' ''(frequency of future loss)''
| How likely is it to happen?
|-
|}

Also represented as <code>Risk = Impact * Probability</code>

{{note|
Often, impact is the primary driver of risk even though the probability may be low. This is because impact is easier to
quantify and measure.

We usually also call impact the "probable impact". A probable impact is a ''reasonable'' "worst case scenario".

If the situation is so remote we think the probability is already null, then this is not a probable impact.
}}

=== Standardized Levels ===

We measure risk, impact, probability, etc. based on a simple 4 levels scale [Risk_Management:Standard levels]. We
use this to '''normalize''' risk measurements. Here's a summary on how it applies to risk.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| <span style="padding: 0 32px;background-color:lightgrey;">LOW</span>
| Low is something we don't expect has impact, or is likely to happen. We don't expect much attention there.
|-
| <span style="padding: 0 20px; background-color:steelblue;">MEDIUM</span>
| Medium is where some risk exists and should at least be acknowledged by service owners. Ideally, steps will be taken
to remedy or mitigate the risk albeit some may instead accept this as residual risk.
|-
| <span style="padding: 0 32px;background-color:#FFF380;">HIGH</span>
| High means we have a problem that we have to fix. The risk is sufficiently important that we have to plan remediations
or mitigations soon. We do not expect high risk to be accepted as residual.
|-
| <span style="padding: 0 14px; background-color:#E77471;">MAXIMUM</span>
| Maximum means we have a significant problem right now. All hands on deck may be required to remedy or mitigate the
risk immediately.
|-
|}

== Risk Measurement ==

Risk can be measured in two ways:

=== Quantifiable risk ===
Risk we can precisely measure and record with ''numbers'':
* How many security controls are present?
* Is the control strength rated?
* How many attacks per day do we see?
* How many times did this happen in the past?
* How many vulnerabilities exist?
* etc.

=== Qualifiable risk ===
Risk we have an idea about but can't accurately measure and is thus subjective.
* How confident are we with the code-base?
* Do we think the project has had sufficient review?
* Do we think this control is efficient?
* etc.

The more quantifiable data we gather, the more accurate the risk measurement and thus the easier and clearer decisions
can be for service owners. We call the data we gather ''data points''.

{{note|Recorded risk is always associated to services.}}

=== Risk records (Security controls and capabilities) ===

Risk records are list of security controls a service have or is lacking and their measure of effectiveness for a given
service. The higher the impact tied to a service, the more effective the security controls have to be. This ensure a
lower likelihood that the service will ever suffer the impact recorded, and thus lowers the service risk.
It also list the service risk assessed by an RRA, including impact and likelihood to different components.

Security controls are categorized by capability ("Inventory", "Vulnerability remediation", "Access control", "Data
recovery", etc.). This allows to also understand which security capabilities a service offers.

* Open Risk Records: http://mzl.la/1EmxXSU
* Closed Risk Records: http://mzl.la/1EmxVdY

=== Impact ''data point'' ===

The [[Security/Risk management/Rapid Risk Assessment|Rapid Risk Assessment]] is currently the single data point for impact and is fairly reliable and
accurate for that measurement.

* Quantifiable results: Normalized financial impact, productivity impact.
* Qualifiable results: Normalized reputation impact.
* Not recorded: legal impact.

| '''[[Security/Risk management/Rapid Risk Assessment|Rapid Risk Assessment]]'''
| The likelihood recorded by the RRA is a best-effort metric that is gathered by asking standard questions. It generally
catches high/maximum likelihood scenarios well, but is not accurate for medium/low scenarios. (i.e. an RRA low likelihood
may in fact be higher than estimated)
|
* Google docs, point in time, manual.
* MozDef, daily refresh from the docs.
| Yes.
| None.
|
* Financial impact probability.
* Reputation impact probability.
* Productivity impact probability.
|-
| '''Vulnerability data'''
| Scanning results from the vulnerability management software. It is difficult to assess exposure through this mean. An
infrasec system user needs to be present. This also includes non-system vulnerabilities such as web application vulnerabilities.
|
* MozDef, daily refresh via vmintgr.
| Yes.
|
* Number of vulnerabilities per system
* CVSS scores
* Standard risk levels
| None.
|-
| '''System policy compliance'''
| System compliance such as "use SSH keys", etc. is checked and recorded by MIG.

mig-agent must be installed on systems.
|
* MozDef, daily refresh from MIG.
| Yes.
|
* Number of failing/successful test for controls or configuration implemented.* Number of systems achieving a certain
security level.
| None.
|-
| '''Bugzilla service bugs'''
| Not yet implemented.
| 
| 
| 
| 
|-
| '''Exposure data'''
| Not yet implemented.
| 
| 
| 
| 
|-
| '''Attacker alerts'''
| NSM and MozDef issue alerts on service attacks. This includes data from threat-exchange type platforms.
|
* MozDef, real-time.
| No.
|
* Number of alerts.
|
* Some of the alerts body may be considered a qualifiable result.
